## Background: 
Understanding whether diabetes and hypertension risks are shared between members of married couples may inform strategies for disease screening and prevention. To date, little is known about diabetes and hypertension concordance among couples in India, where chronic diseases are rapidly rising. 

## Objective: 
To investigate spousal concordance in prevalence of diabetes and hypertension in a national sample of Indian adults. 

## Design: 
Cross-sectional.

## Setting: 
Indiaâ€™s National Family Health Survey-V, 2019-21

## Participants:  
50,023 heterosexual married couples (women: 18-49 years, men: 21-54 years)  

## Measurements: 
We estimated the prevalence ratio (PR) and 95% CI to describe concordance (i.e. co-occurrence beyond what is statistically expected) in diabetes and hypertension status between spouses using survey-weighted modified Poisson regression. 

## Results: 
The prevalence of diabetes and of hypertension were 7.5% [95%CI: 7.2, 7.9] and 29.1% [28.5, 29.8] in married men and 4.4% [4.1, 4.7] and 20.6% [20.0, 21.1] in married women. Co-occurrence of diabetes and hypertension were 1.0% [0.8, 1.1] and 8.4% [8.0, 8.8], respectively. Married women and men were over twice as likely to have diabetes if their spouses had the condition (husband with diabetes : PR=2.18 [1.83, 2.60]; wife with diabetes: PR=2.07 [1.78, 2.42]). Similarly, married women and men were more likely to have hypertension if their spouses had the disease (husband with hypertension: PR=1.37 [1.30, 1.44]; wife with hypertension: PR=1.32 [1.26, 1.38]). 

## Limitation: 
Diagnosis of diabetes and hypertension were based on self-reports and one time point assessments of biomarkers

## Conclusion: 
There is substantial diabetes and hypertension concordance in Indian couples. These findings present opportunities for screening spouses of those diagnosed with diabetes and hypertension nationally.
